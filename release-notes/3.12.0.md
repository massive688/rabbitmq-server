## RabbitMQ 3.12.0-beta.3

RabbitMQ `3.12.0-beta.3` is a preview of a new feature release.

## Highlights

This release includes several new features and optimizations and graduates (makes mandatory) a number of feature flags.

The user-facing areas that have seen the biggest improvements in this release are

 * Lower MQTT and Web MQTT memory footprint per connection
 * Reduced quorum queue memory footprint, improved throughput stability under load
 * Classic queue message store memory efficiency and footprint predictability
 * OAuth 2, OIDC, IDP support

This release also features many internal API improvements in preparation to 4.0
with [Khepri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huT-zmXvfuM).

See Compatibility Notes below to learn about breaking or potentially breaking changes in this release.

## Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 25.0](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
This introduces feature parity for x86- and ARM64-based CPUs: Erlang 25 offers the JIT and
[modern Flame Graph profiling](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/) tooling
for both of those major CPU architectures.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 25.x.


## Upgrading to 3.12

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
for release notes of other releases.

### Required Feature Flags

RabbitMQ 3.12.0 will require all feature flags from the 3.11.x release series to be enabled before upgrading,
similarly to how [3.11.0 required all feature flags introduced before 3.9.0](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/required-feature-flags-in-rabbitmq-3.11/).

If the feature flags are not enabled, RabbitMQ 3.12 and later nodes will refuse to start.

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 3.12.0 nodes can run alongside `3.11.x` nodes. `3.12.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 3.12.0 or any other patch release in the new series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.12.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).



## Compatibility Notes

### More Feature Flags Gratuate to Core Features ("Always Enabled")

RabbitMQ 3.12.0 will require **all** feature flags from the 3.11.x release series to be enabled before upgrading.

If the feature flags are not enabled, RabbitMQ 3.12 and later nodes will refuse to start.

### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Starting with this release, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25.0 or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start**
on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.


### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.11.x` will be compatible with `3.12.0`.



### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).



## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.11.x/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

All bug fixes worth mentioning in this release have also shipped
in the `3.11.x` release series.

#### Enhancements

 * Quorum queues now sustain higher throughput with large backlogs. They also offer higher throughput
   on average, and in particular when [Single Active Consumer](https://rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#single-active-consumer) is used.

   GitHub issue: [#7553](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7553#issuecomment-1463660454)

 * Reduced memory footprint, improved memory use predictability and throughput of classic queues.
   This particularly benefits classic queues with longer backlogs.

   GitHub issues: [#4522](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4522), [#7516](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7516)

 * Reduced peak memory footprint of quorum queues.

   GitHub issue: [#7175](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7175)

 * Improved stream leader distribution efficiency. Mostly relevant to environments with lots of
   streams.

   GitHub issue: [#6440](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6440)

 * All [feature flags](https://www.rabbitmq.com/feature-flags.html) introduced before 3.11.0 are now required to be enabled. Make sure
   all feature flags are enabled before upgrading to 3.12.0.

   GitHub issue: [#7219](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7219)

 * Plugin and core API: all schema data store operations are now available via the `rabbit_db_*` modules.
   Plugin maintainers should switch to them for an easier transition to a future 4.0 release.

   GitHub issues: [#6430](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6430), [#6821](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6821)

 * Plugin and core API: node data directory now should be accessed using `rabbit:data_dir/0`.

   GitHub issue: [#6462](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6462)

 * Initial Erlang 26 compatibility

   GitHub issues: [#7443](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7443)

 * There is now a way to pre-configure users and their permissions for newly created virtual hosts:

  ``` ini
  default_users.qa_user.vhost_pattern = qa.*
  default_users.qa_user.tags = policymaker,monitoring
  default_users.qa_user.password = fd237824441a78cd922410af4b83f0888186a8d7
  default_users.qa_user.read = .*
  default_users.qa_user.write = .*
  default_users.qa_user.configure = .*
  ```
   This is primarily useful in environments where RabbitMQ is provided as a service but
   customers (clients) have control over virtual hosts.

   GitHub issue: [#7208](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/7208).

 * Policies can now be defined to only apply to specific queue types.

   For example, it is now possible to have two policies matching all queue names ('.*')
   but one applicable only to one queue type, and the other only to different queue type,
   without conflicts.

   For example, this policy will only apply to quorum queues and not streams or classic queues:

   ``` bash
   rabbitmqctl set_policy at-least-once-dead-lettering ".*" '{"dead-letter-strategy": "at-least-once"}' --apply-to quorum_queues
   ```

### CLI Tools

#### Features

 * `rabbitmq-queues rebalance` now supports streams in addition to classic and quorum queues.

   GitHub issue: [#6440](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6440)

 * `rabbitmq-streams restart_stream` is a new command that can be used to kick off
   a new leader election for a stream. This is another option that can be used
   to rebalance stream leaders across cluster nodes.

   GitHub issue: [#6440](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6440)

 * Classic queue metrics are now available via `rabbitmq-diagnostics observer`.

   GitHub issue: [#3314](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3314)

 * `rabbitmqctl set_permissions_globally` is a new command that sets up user permissions in all existing virtual hosts.

   GitHub issue: [#1000](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1000)

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics cluster_status` now lists how many CPU cores are available to individual nodes, plus a total.

   GitHub issue: [#7135](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7135)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Significant (up to more than 90% with some workloads) reduction in memory footprint of MQTT connections,
   and a double digit % reduction in memory footprint of MQTT-over-WebSockets (Web MQTT) connections.

   GitHub issues: [#5895](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5895), [#7091](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7091), [#7234](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7234)


### Management Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Support for Identity Provider-initiated Login (IDP).

   GitHub issues: [#6015](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6015), [#6201](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6201),
   [#6247](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6247)


### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Consul peer discovery now correctly determines if the node uses long or short names.

   Contributed by @SimonUnge (AWS).

   GitHub issue: [#4230](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4230)
